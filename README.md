# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Purpose
    The Purpose of the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis is to gather worker data from Hewlett Packard, and then analyze it 
    to come up with solutions or ideas to deal with the "silver tsunami". Workers are getting old, and as time 
    goes by workers and their skill sets may become obsolete as technology evolves and the company pivots from 
    one direction to another. Through extracting and interpreting data using SQL, Hewlett Packard is able to 
    determine what needs to be done in order to address thie phenomenon.
    
### Major Points
    Through gathering retirement information about Hewlett Packard there can be 4 points that could be made:
      * Most of the workers retiring per profession are Senior Engineers with 29,414 retirees, Senior Staff
        with 28,255, Engineers with 14,222, Staff with 12,242, Techinique Leader, with 4502, Assistant Engieer with 1761,
        and Managers with only 2 retirees.
      * Mentorship eligibility are workers that were born around 1965, and have worked in the company for about 3-5 years,
        with most of the staff generally being senior engineers and staff.
      * Workers generally spend around 2-3 years in their final occupation for Hewlett Packard mostly
        as Senior Staff and Engineer.
      * Based on the different promotions there are several workers that were promoted once or more. These workers would 
        work for Hewlett Packard for a decade or longer, finally becoming senior staff or engineers.
### Summary
    After the silver tsunami, there would need to be 90,397 staff that will be needed to replace the aging workers that 
    will retire after working for the company for years.
